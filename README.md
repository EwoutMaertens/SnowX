# SnowX
Microservice architecture for taking care of all services needed when hosting a Ski Resort. This implementation is based off a school project from UGent and serves only for practice purposes.

## Original Project
The original project and design was created by Cedric Arickx, Matthias De Fr√©, Nigel Mestach and myself. Credit goes to my colleagues as much to me.

The project was created in Java, as well as it was hosted with docker-compose and it would have to be spun up manually.

## New Project
I will be using the same services as the school project, but I will update the language from Java to Python. I will also update the Docker files to work with Python. The end goal is that I can set up a cluster for the services automatically with Ansible and Kubernetes.

This project only server for learning purposes and should not be used for any other reason.

Architecture is based off: Clean Architectures in Python by Leonardo Giordani
